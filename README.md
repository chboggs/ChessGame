# ChessGame

This is a simple chess game I created following learning about classes in C++ in the winter of 2015.

The game prints the gameboard following every move and checks if moves are valid.

Moves are made by selecting a piece by entering the x and y location of the piece's current location and new location following the move. Coordinates are in the yx format

EX: "22 32" moves a piece from point 22 to point 32

The game can be ran using the executable included
